Section 8 of the Act specifies that the expropriation shall take place in accordance with the General Act on expropriation (Legislative Decree No. 313). Section 9 provides that on the board of directors (elected by the shareholders’ meeting) of each enterprise to which the Act applies there shall be a representative of the regularly employed workers, a representative of small- and medium-sized employers and, for banking and finance, a representative of the depositors. The workers’ representative shall be elected by the per- manently employed workers of each enterprise in direct, secret and universal balloting.

Act No. 9 on bodies concerned with the representation, determination of working conditions and participation of staff of the public administration. (ibid., 17 June) In the Act’s statement of purpose it is recalled that art. 103.3 of the Constitution states that the special characteristics of the right of public officials to organise was to be governed by law. Within this framework and taking into account ILO Conventions, suggestions of trade union organisations and the requests of public officials themselves, Basic Act No. 11 of 2 August 1985 on freedom of association (LS 1985—Sp. 1) had accorded unified treatment as to the basic contents of the right of free association by including public officials within its scope. Therefore that Act’s precepts with regard to freedom of association, the legal status of trade unions, the representative nature of trade unions, trade union action, those entitled to exercise freedom of association and suppression of anti-trade union conduct—which are subjects not regulated by the present Act—apply directly to the public administration.

The Act establishes two types of pension plans based upon the nature of the participants and the contractual obligations; it defines as basic principles for plans the following: non-discrimination, mandatory participation in a pension fund, the non- waivable nature of contributions by the sponsoring entity, implementation through schemes involving capitalisation and assignment of rights to plan assets for participants and be- neficiaries, time-limits and limits on amounts in relation to participants’ acquired rights, and thorisation to move assets for the sole purpose of applying them to another plan. The Act establishes requirements and controls designed to ensure the development of funds and to avoid insolvency or situations which might threaten the ability to pay benefits, by introducing for this purpose, in particular, requirements regarding fund administration, representation of a management body with the collaboration of a trustee and supervision by auditing committees. The Act sets forth types of infringements and the corresponding penalties. Pension funds are not subject to any taxation.
