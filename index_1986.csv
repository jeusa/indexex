1,ALGERIA,,"17/XII/1985  Decree No. 85-306 to establish a general inspectorate for educational activities  attached to the Ministry of higher education, (ibid., 18 Dec).  9/II/1986  National Charter, (ibid., 16 Feb.)  [The new National Charter promulgated on 16 February 1986 is a constitutional document. It is  a sequel to a number of basic texts adopted since the beginning of the Algerian revolution,  including the first Charter of 1976, which this latest Charter is intended to supplement and  extend. Like its predecessor, the 1986 Charter is in the form of a statement of general principles  rather than a set of detailed rights and obligations. The preamble explains the historical bases of  Algerian society in some detail. Title  1  then describes the ideological background of Islam and  socialism, Title 2 the national institutions, i.e. the Party, the State and the supervisory  machinery, and Title 3 the over-all development of the nation (organisation of the economy;  rural, industrial, cultural, social and regional development; promotion of the nations resources).  The final Title defines the basic principles that apply to work, employment, wages, social  protection and training. The Charter states that work is not only a right but also a duty;  parasitism and idleness must be eradicated. Wage policy is based on the concept of a guaranteed  minimum wage and wage relationships will be harmonised by means of a national classification  scheme. The Charter favours the employment of women, subject to strict rules to ensure the  protection of maternity and guarantee family unity. It also provides for the encouragement of  small and medium-sized undertakings, in both the public and the private sectors. The 1986  Charter was adopted by referendum on 16 January 1986 by 10,508,863 votes in favour to  181,063 against.]  ",1

4,ANGOLA,,"24/III/1986  Act No. 6, to regulate the status of resident foreign workers.  (Diario da República,  24 Mar.)  [The Act is applicable in respect of foreign nationals residing in Angola and recruited locally. It  applies neither to salaried workers recruited abroad, nor to foreign workers without scientific  and technical qualifications, who remain subject to the General Labour Act of  1981.  The new  Act provides for equality of treatment between foreign and Angolan workers in matters  pertaining to health care, insurance against industrial accidents, retirement pensions, wagefixing and the payment of income tax. Foreign workers are not allowed to enter into contracts of  employment with foreign companies, or engage in any other form of gainful activity without  permission from the appropriate ministry. The Act makes no provision for the remittance of  a  portion of the worker's remuneration to their country of origin, but it does provide for the  possibility of taking back goods that were imported or acquired by lawful means, subject to such  conditions as may be laid down by the Ministry of Finance. This new statute cancels and  replaces the earlier one, dating back to Decree No. 22 of 1978. It was made in accordance with  the General Labour Act of  1981  which was published in the Legislative Series (1981—Ang.l).]  ",1

Indigenous communities are  granted separate legal personality (s. 2), which they obtain by registering with the registry of  indigenous communities; relations inside the communities will be regulated by the Laws  governing co-operatives or mutual or other  associations.  Land adjudication programmes are to  be set up by the executive authorities. The adjudication of land will be effected through the  transfer of State-owned land to the communities, or, if there are none available, through the  transfer of provincial or communal land, or, if necessary, through the expropriation of privately  owned land. Adjudications will be free of charges and tax, and preferential loans will be  available for land development and farming.

[These Regulations, which are in line with the United States policy of ""constructive  engagement"", require United States firms in South Africa to take good faith measures to  implement fair labour standards and to report to the Department of State in this regard. Fair  labour standards are defined as desegregating the races in each employment facility, providing  equal employment opportunity for all employees without regard to race or ethnic origin,  assuring that the pay system is applied to all employees without regard to race or ethnic origin,  establishing an appropriate minimum living wage and salary structure, increasing by  appropriate means the number of persons who are disadvantaged by the apartheid system in  managerial, supervisory, administrative, clerical and technical  jobs,  taking steps to improve the  quality of employees' lives outside the work environment with respect to housing, transportation, schooling, recreation and health, and recognising the right of all employees to  self organisation and to form, join or assist labour organisations freely and without penalty or  reprisal, as well as the  right  to refrain from such activity. The Regulations apply to United States  nationals who employ at least 25 individuals in South Africa, or who own or control more than  50 per cent of the outstanding voting securities of a foreign subsidiary or other entity that  employs at least that number,  or  who controls  in  fact (as further defined) any other foreign entity  employing that number. These United States nationals are required to register, to maintain  records regarding fair labour practices, and to report annually to the Department of State  regarding the implementation of the principles. Bona fide participants subscribing to the  voluntary Sullivan Code and filing reports thereunder are exempt from the requirement of  submitting a separate detailed annual report. The Office of Southern African Affairs of the  Department of State is to prepare an overall annual report concerning the implementation of the  general policies and reporting requirements.  In  cases of non-adherence, the Regulations provide  that no United States department or agency may intercede with any foreign government  regarding export marketing activity (promoting sales, participating in trade fairs, etc.). Failure  to comply the reporting an4 registration requirements (only) is subject to a civil penalty  involving a fine of up to US $ 10,000, or up to 50,000 in cases of wilful violation (this does not  apply to financing of experts by the Export-Import Bank to South Africa).
